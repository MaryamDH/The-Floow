# The Floow Test Project - Steps to use the Project:
* Download the project in zip format 
* Start appium server
* Run the project using the main class (Install.java)

Points to Consider:
* The 'chronometer' & 'image view led' present in the home page of the app is not configured to work since it requires GPS in the computer system
* I have used uiautomatorviewer for finding the elements in the Floow App
* I have tried to use simplest way of coding to cover few test scenarios demonstrating Abstraction,Polymorphism,Encapsulation & Inheritance
* Please let me know if you need any further information about running the tests from the project.
